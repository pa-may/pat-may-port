        <br><br>
        <p>Overview</p>
        <h2>Instagram is a social network media platform form in 2009 allowing users to share photos and videos to other
            users. Primarily for entertainment and communication purposes.

            <br>
            <br>
            Over the years the application has generated a high number of users not only from your average joe but now
            big and small business self-proclaimed entrepreneurs and influencers have taken advantage of this visibility
            to markets and promote their business/products.

        </h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>Issue</p>
        <h2>However, Instagram initially design as a mobile application focus more on the mobile version as to desktop
            or tablet. Some features are not available or accessible on the desktop version as to the mobile version.
            <br>
            This can be difficult for people who use Instagram for work purposes when most of the features are on
            mobile. I.e., marketing agencies, business or influencers?

            Redesign Instagram for desktop
            responsibility is to deliver an outstanding design to cater for the current issue regarding missing features
            on the desktop version.
            What would Instagram look like if it was designed for marketing agencies, or for influencers?
